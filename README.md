This project is going to be a single page application(SPA) using React, Flux, Node.js, MongoDB, D3 and Webpack to make an attractive mind mapping application called “Bubblesort”.
A Persons brain processes visual information far quicker than it does text, which makes Mind Maps a great tool. As a result of organising information visually, it’s simple to understand tricky concepts and engage more with the ideas that you’ve been thinking about. You can visually represent the links between concepts, you can plan your ideas more easily - share them or explore concepts in greater depth. 
Have you ever heard the phrase – “A picture is worth a thousand words?” Well this is especially true when it comes to data visualisation. Data is confusing and lists are boring as well as unimaginative - People are visual by nature and prefer new, constructive means of looking at information. Because of all of this visual analytics is a very popular aspect of Data Mining, as I learned from a module “Data Mining and Data Warehousing” thought by my supervisor Dr.Nik Nikolov where we talked about visual analytics. “Visual Analytics is the science of analytical reasoning supported by a highly interactive visual interface” (Thomas and Cook, 2005).
The purpose of this project is to create a web-application in which users can sign up and easily create a Visual Network (A Mind Map). The Mind Map should be capable of mapping out a users ideas or used for organisational purposes. The Mind Map should look aesthetically pleasing as well as responding well to interaction from a user. There are multiple tiers to the Network, so that the user is able to navigate into a node on the network visualisation and then see the Graph populated out with that nodes children. This will allow topics/areas to be fully visual and to understand the relationships held in an intricate network.
